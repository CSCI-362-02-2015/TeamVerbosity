# Team Verbosity
*Team Verbosity* is a software development team formed for Jim Bowring's CSCI-362-01 course for the fall 2015 section. This git repository will serve as a hub (no pun intended) for their work for the semester.

On Team Verbosity, we believe that words are important. Getting ideas out of conceptual space is one of the central components of good software design and development. This is our space to do that.

##Team Members
* Robert Moore
* Winslow Dibona
* Joel Dettweiler

##Projects
 * myList: A list function written for UNIX. When activated, LIST will return the current directory's contents and print them to an HTML document.
